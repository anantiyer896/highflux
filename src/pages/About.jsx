                    Welcome to the realm of warriors; where fortunes are decided, where battles are fought for glory and where victory is coveted by all. Beset on all four sides by honourable armies vigorously contending for the enviable “Helm of Kronos”, the crusade is about to begin. 
                    Now, stretch your gaze to the horizon where the monarchs of the different dominions inhabit their kingdoms. Zeus, the brash and hubristic; Poseidon, as erratic as the seas in which he dominated; the lovely Iris, as resplendent as the rainbow she represented; and Medusa armed with her petrifying gaze, hell-bent on vengeance.
                    To stay faithful to the spirit of camaraderie, every fighter has to follow a set of rules set in stone. The Ethos Index has been formulated with that in mind. Climb the stairway, constantly assailed by trials, to claim your rightful reward.

                <h4>Rationale</h4>
                HighFlux is designed to replace Fun Fridays. In HighFlux we have mainly divided the entire Babba empire into 4 different houses namely <br/>

                    1.1 House of Poseidon <br/>
                    1.2 House of Zeus <br/>
                    1.3 House of Iris <br/>
                    1.4 House of Medusa <br/>
                   <br/>
                    These 4 houses are further divided into 40 different clans in such a way that each house has 10 clans within them.<br/><br/>

                <p style={{textAlign:"justify", marginLeft:"3vw"}}>
                2.1 VPs & Above will be known as WarLords.<br/>

                2.3 From Highakos till Associate Managers will be known as Troopers.<br/>
                </p>

                <h4> Ideology</h4>
                <p>
                
                <p style={{textAlign:"justify", marginLeft:"3vw"}}>
                3.1. The concept of HighFlux is to create competition among the 4 
                       houses and 40 clans.<br/>
                3.2. The Houses and Clans are divided in such a way that the 
                     members from every department are present in each of the 
                     House and Clan respectively. The idea is to promote connectivity 
                     amongst the employees and cross functional  collaborations.<br/>
                3.3. The Clans will fight against each other in Clan Wars on every 4th  
                      Friday of the month to be the “Superior Amongst The Best”.<br/>
                3.4. And the Houses will clash on every 2nd Friday in the House      
                        Battles.<br/>

                <p>
                <p style={{textAlign:"justify", marginLeft:"3vw"}}>
                4.1. As mentioned in clause 3.3, on every 4th Friday of the month 
                       there will be clan wars.<br/>

                4.2. The clans along with their opponents will fight against each 
                        other to be the “Superior Amongst The Best”. The war 
                        schedule along with the content will be decided by P&C and the 
                        list will be shared with all the warriors before the battle.  (On 
                        1st & 3rd Mondays of every month we will share the content and    
                        details).<br/>

                4.3. A P&C representative will join the clan wars just to oversee it and 
                       will rate the warriors based on their individual performances.<br/> 

                4.4. The earned warrior points will be displayed on the HighFlux 
                        dashboard and will play an important role in determining the 
                        Knight & Dame at the end of the year.<br/>

                4.5. Clan wars will be organised on Zoom calls. For 40 clans there 
                       will be 20 different Zoom links and two teams will be present in 
                       the same link. For e.g. Link 1: Clan A vs Clan B, Link 2: Clan C vs 
                       Clan D and so on.<br/>

                4.6. Only Inter-Clan wars are allowed. (No battles within the house)<br/> 

                4.7. The winning clan will get 1 drachma and the losing clan will get 
                        0 drachma. And these drachmae will be added to their respective 
                        House Treasure Chest. (drachma = point)<br/>

                <p style={{textAlign:"justify", marginLeft:"3vw"}}>
                5.1. On every 2nd Friday of the month the houses will clash amongst 
                    themselves in a battle. (For e.g. House Zeus vs House Poseidon)<br/>

                5.2. P&C will schedule the wars and will decide the opponents 
                    accordingly.<br/> 
                5.3. The House Battle will be organised as a webinar and P&C will 
                    organise a quest before every battle to look for the warriors who 
                    will be representing their respective houses in the House Battle 
                    and will be Fighting For Their Glory.<br/> 
                    (As Zoom only accommodates a certain number of people we have to 
                    organise a quest before every battle.)<br/>

                5.4. An Expert panel to judge the performances might be created in 
                    exceptional situations.<br/>
                5.5. The winning house will get 10 drachmae and the losing house will 
                    get 0 drachma. [drachmae: ancient currency of the Greeks]<br/>
                5.6. The drachmae earned in the Clan Wars will be added to the 
                     respective House Treasure Chests.<br/>

                6.1. The winning house at the end of the year will claim the “Helm of

                6.2. The top two performers across the Babba Empire will be 
                     honoured with the title of “Knight & Dame”.<br/> 
                    (“Knight” : top male performer; “Dame”: top female performer 
                     of the winning house)<br/> 

                6.3. Needless to say, there will be rewards for the winning House
